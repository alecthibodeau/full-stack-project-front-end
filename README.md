# RadTabs
## Full-Stack Project: Front-End

## Description

Keep tabs on your work with RadTabs. With RadTabs you can track your projects with details like dates, tasks, time and custom notes. Anyone with self-directed projects can use RadTabs — artists, carpenters, gardeners, bike mechanics and more. Create and save tabs by signing up for an account with any available email address: even a dummy one.

## Technologies

I developed the RadTabs website as my second project while a student in the Web Development Immersive (WDI) course at General Assembly. I used JavaScript, CSS3/Sass, HTML5, Handlebars – with some Bootstrap for modals – as my primary programs for the front-end work. For the back-end I built an API using Ruby, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. The database is stored at Heroku.

Technical Specifications
- Single page application
- Custom API
- RESTful routes for handling GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
- AJAX for interacting with the custom API
- Responsive web design with original styling

## Background

This project is a tracking program for the development of loosely-structured work. It allows a user to record the details of self-directed tasks. As an artist myself I've used such techniques before: usually scribbles on paper to jot down time spent on a drawing, which particular artists were inspiring me at the time, what library book I had referenced for research or the pen I was using.

With the RadTabs website I can easily track the progress of my projects. I call the data entries "tabs" — as in keeping tabs on my work. Anyone completing self-directed work can use RadTabs to keep tabs on what they do: woodworkers, plumbers, knitters, etc. The stored data can be referenced later anytime.

## Features

Users of RadTabs can create an account from an email address and password, then sign-in with this account to start recording tabs for their work – data that is privately accessible to each individual user. Users can create, read, update and delete any tab. When a user signs out all tabs becomes hidden and remain private.

## User Stories

- As a visitor to the RadTabs website, I want to know how to sign up and sign in so that I can become a user.
- As a signed-in user I need to see what options are available to me so that I can use them to record my work.
- As a user accessing the options I need to know how to create new tabs and modify existing ones: create, read, update, delete.
- As a user who has finished entering my tabs information I need to know how to sign out so that I can keep my tabs private.

## Future Features

- Add calculations, so that a user can add up the number of hours spent on a project, for example.
